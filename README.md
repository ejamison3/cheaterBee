## <a name="about"></a>About Cheater Bee
Cheater Bee is built with a flask Python backend and a React (using create-react-app) front end

## <a name="install"></a>How to Install and Run
To start the backend, go into the cheaterbee_flask subdirectory and enter 'flask run' in the command line
To start the frontend, go into the cheaterbee_client subdirectory and enter 'npm start' in the command line. 

## <a name="dictionary"></a>Dictionary
The dictionary is the standard dictionary in a mac. It's pretty horrible. If you have access to a better dictionary (i.e., collection of words you want to search), then I highly recommend replacing the dictionary.txt file inside the cheaterbee_flask directory. Words inside this file should each be on a separate line.

## <a name="iterations></a>Other Iterations
The original cheater bee was a command line tool written in C. You can find it in my github under the name cheaterbee-cli. It's lovely. You should check it out.
